### Emotion-Based Movie Recommendation System
## Introduction
This project implements an innovative emotion-based movie recommendation system using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The system captures a user's facial expression through a camera, predicts their emotional state, and recommends a movie based on the detected emotion. This unique approach to movie recommendations aims to provide a personalized and engaging user experience by aligning film suggestions with the viewer's current emotional state.
## Project Overview
The core of this project lies in the integration of emotion detection technology with a curated movie database. Here's a breakdown of the key components and how they work together:
Emotion Detection Model: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on facial expression images forms the backbone of the emotion detection system. This model can classify facial expressions into seven categories: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.
Movie Database: A carefully curated list of movies is associated with each emotion category. These associations are based on the general mood and themes of the films, ensuring that the recommendations align with the detected emotion.
Web Application: The user interface is built using Streamlit, providing an intuitive and interactive experience for users to capture their image and receive movie recommendations.
### How the Project Was Developed
## Data Collection and Preprocessing
The project began with the collection of a diverse dataset of facial expression images. These images were preprocessed to ensure consistency in size (48x48 pixels) and color (grayscale). Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, width and height shifts, and horizontal flips were applied to enhance the model's robustness.
## Model Architecture and Training
The emotion detection model was built using TensorFlow and Keras. The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers for classification. The model was trained on the preprocessed dataset, with careful monitoring of validation accuracy to prevent overfitting.
## Integration with Movie Recommendations
A Python dictionary was created to map emotions to lists of movie recommendations. This allowed for quick and efficient retrieval of movie suggestions based on the detected emotion.
## Web Application Development
The Streamlit framework was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in creating data-centric web applications. The app was designed to capture images from the user's camera, process them through the emotion detection model, and display the results along with a movie recommendation.
